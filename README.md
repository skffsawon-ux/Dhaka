## Overview

The Innate OS provides the runtime environment for Innate robots. Developers can create powerful spatial applications using mobility, manipulation, interaction, and planning.

It is designed on a few **core principles**:

- Lightweight: The Innate OS can run on resource-constrained hardware like the Jetson Orin Nano 8GB. It starts in an under a minute.
- Intuitive: Creating a program should be easy and not need to touch ROS at all. And the OS can be controlled via the Innate phone app.
- Powerful: The Innate OS can be quickly extended to perform long-range tasks with robots. It natively supports VLAs and agentic workflows.

## Quick Start (Simulation)

If you don't have a robot, you can simply start the Innate OS in simulation mode, then use [our simulator](https://github.com/innate-inc/genesis-sim) to try out the robot with a web interface.

> **Note:** The Docker build defaults to simulation mode, which skips NVIDIA Jetson-specific packages. See [SIMULATION_MODE.md](SIMULATION_MODE.md) for details on switching between simulation and hardware modes.

First build the container:

```bash
docker compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml build
```

Then run the container:

```bash
docker compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml up -d
```

And then drop into the container:

```bash
docker compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml exec innate zsh -l
```

Inside the container, launch all simulation nodes in tmux:

```bash
./scripts/launch_sim_in_tmux.zsh
```

This starts everything in organized tmux windows:
- **Window 0 (zenoh)**: Zenoh router
- **Window 1 (rosbridge-app)**: Rosbridge + App control
- **Window 2 (webrtc)**: Webrtc transmitter for the phone app
- **Window 3 (nav-brain)**: Navigation + Brain client
- **Window 4 (behavior)**: Controlling the arm

Switch between windows with `Ctrl+b` then `n`/`p` or `0`/`1`/`2`. Detach with `Ctrl+b d`.

You can use novnc to connect to rviz2. After launching rviz2 inside the container, connect in your browser:

```bash
http://localhost:8080/vnc.html
```

## Quick start (Physical Robot)

Simply SSH into the robot.

- If it's the first time and you're installing it, clone the repository and execute the post_update.sh script to complete the setup.

- Execute the launch_ros_in_tmux.sh script to start the ROS nodes.

Connect via the app like explained in the [documentation](https://docs.innate.bot).

## Building from Source

### Dependencies

All dependencies are managed through config files in `ros2_ws/`:

| File | Description | Usage |
|------|-------------|-------|
| `apt-dependencies.txt` | System & ROS2 apt packages | `xargs sudo apt-get install -y < apt-dependencies.txt` |
| `pip-requirements.txt` | Python packages | `pip3 install -r pip-requirements.txt` |
| `src/dependencies.repos` | External ROS2 repositories | `vcs import src < src/dependencies.repos` |

### Build with Docker (Recommended)

The easiest way to build is using Docker, which works on any platform:

```bash
# Build the Docker image (includes full ROS2 workspace build)
docker build -t innate-os -f Dockerfile.build .

# Run interactively
docker run -it innate-os bash
```

### Build Locally (Ubuntu 22.04 + ROS2 Humble)

```bash
# Install apt dependencies
cd ros2_ws
xargs sudo apt-get install -y < apt-dependencies.txt

# Install Python dependencies
pip3 install -r pip-requirements.txt

# Import external ROS2 dependencies
cd src
vcs import < dependencies.repos
cd ..

# Install any remaining ROS dependencies via rosdep
rosdep install --from-paths src --ignore-src -r -y

# Build
source /opt/ros/humble/setup.bash
colcon build
```

### Adding Dependencies

- **APT packages**: Add to `ros2_ws/apt-dependencies.txt`
- **Python packages**: Add to `ros2_ws/pip-requirements.txt`
- **External ROS2 repos**: Add to `ros2_ws/src/dependencies.repos`

These files are used by both the local build and CI/CD pipeline.

## Releases

Releases are automatically built via GitHub Actions when a version tag is pushed:

```bash
git tag v1.0.0
git push origin v1.0.0
```

Each release includes:
- `innate-os-{version}.tar.gz` - Full release with pre-built artifacts
- `innate-os-{version}-source.tar.gz` - Source code only
